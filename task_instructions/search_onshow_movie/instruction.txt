Find me at least 3 movies that are suitable for children below the age of 15, and are going to be on show in movie theaters in Boston, Massachusetts until end of next month. 
For each movie, provide the film rating, the last showing date in Boston,  a brief intro on what the movie is about, a link to their trailers, and a movie theaters in Boston that shows the movie until end of next month.
