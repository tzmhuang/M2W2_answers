A $8/lb strip loin to cut up myself and a $4/lb brisket is hard to beat. I'd love to go to my local butcher but they raised prices even more than grocery stores. $17-18/lb for ribeye, $13-16/NY strip.' This information was used to estimate the ribeye prices for Whole Foods and Littleton's Market, as high-end grocery stores often have similar pricing."
