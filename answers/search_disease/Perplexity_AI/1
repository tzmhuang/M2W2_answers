Final Answer:

Three common diseases that can cause fever and skin rash in a 1-year-old child are:

1. Roseola
2. Fifth Disease
3. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD)

Here are the full list of symptoms for each:

## Roseola

- High fever (often above 103°F or 39.4°C) lasting 3-5 days
- Sudden drop in fever followed by a rash
- Rash: small pink spots or patches on the chest, back, and abdomen, spreading to the neck, arms, and sometimes face and legs
- Irritability
- Mild diarrhea
- Decreased appetite
- Swollen eyelids
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck
- Possible sore throat, runny nose, or cough

## Fifth Disease

- Low-grade fever
- Headache
- Runny nose
- Bright red rash on cheeks ("slapped cheek" appearance)
- Lacy red rash on arms, legs, and trunk
- Joint pain and swelling (more common in adults)
- Possible mild cold-like symptoms before rash appears

## Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD)

- Fever
- Sore throat
- Loss of appetite
- Painful sores in the mouth
- Red spots on the palms of hands and soles of feet
- Possible rash on buttocks, legs, and arms
- Irritability in infants and toddlers

- Possible mild abdominal pain

It's important to note that these symptoms can vary in severity and not all children will experience all symptoms. If you're concerned about your child's health, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.
