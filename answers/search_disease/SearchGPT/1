When a 1-year-old presents with fever and skin rash, three common diseases to consider are:

**1. Roseola (Exanthema Subitum):**

- **Symptoms:**
  - High fever (often exceeding 102°F or 39°C) lasting 3–5 days.
  - As the fever subsides, a pinkish-red rash emerges, starting on the trunk and spreading to the neck, face, and limbs.
  - The rash consists of small, flat, or slightly raised lesions and is generally not itchy.
  - Other possible symptoms include mild respiratory issues like cough or runny nose, and mild diarrhea.

**2. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD):**

- **Symptoms:**
  - Fever.
  - Painful sores in the mouth.
  - Skin rash with red spots and sometimes blisters on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and occasionally the buttocks.
  - The rash is typically not itchy in children but can be painful.
  - Other symptoms may include fatigue and loss of appetite.

**3. Scarlet Fever:**

- **Symptoms:**
  - Sore throat.
  - Fever.
  - Bright red rash with a sandpaper-like texture, usually starting on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas.
  - "Strawberry" tongue (red and bumpy).
  - Flushed face with a pale area around the mouth.
  - The rash may be itchy and can lead to peeling of the skin as it fades.

It's important to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment if your child exhibits these symptoms.
