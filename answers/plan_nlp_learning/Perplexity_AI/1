Final Answer:

Here's a learning path for a freshman with no prior knowledge to learn natural language processing, consisting of five Coursera or EdX courses in increasing order of difficulty:

1. Introduction to Natural Language Processing
   Provider: Coursera (University of Michigan)
   Level: Beginner
   Duration: 4 weeks
   Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing

2. Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models
   Provider: Coursera (DeepLearning.AI)
   Level: Intermediate
   Duration: 4 weeks
   Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-models-in-nlp

3. Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
   Provider: Coursera (DeepLearning.AI)
   Level: Intermediate
   Duration: 4 weeks
   Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp

4. Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models
   Provider: Coursera (DeepLearning.AI)
   Level: Advanced
   Duration: 4 weeks
   Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp

5. Natural Language Processing with Attention Models
   Provider: Coursera (DeepLearning.AI)
   Level: Advanced
   Duration: 4 weeks
   Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/attention-models-in-nlp

This learning path starts with an introductory course and progressively moves to more advanced topics, covering various aspects of NLP from basic concepts to advanced techniques like attention models.
