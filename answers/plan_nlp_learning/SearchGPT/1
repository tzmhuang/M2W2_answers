To develop a comprehensive understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as a freshman with no prior knowledge, consider the following learning path comprising five courses from Coursera and edX, arranged in increasing order of difficulty:

1. **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
   *Provider:* IBM via Coursera  
   *Level:* Beginner  
   *Duration:* 1-4 weeks  
   *Link:* [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-ai)  
   *Description:* This course provides a broad understanding of AI concepts, including machine learning and NLP, serving as a foundation for more specialized NLP studies.

2. **Natural Language Processing: Foundations**  
   *Provider:* National University of Singapore via edX  
   *Level:* Beginner  
   *Duration:* 4 weeks  
   *Link:* [Natural Language Processing: Foundations](https://www.edx.org/learn/natural-language-processing/the-national-university-of-singapore-natural-language-processing-foundations)  
   *Description:* This course introduces the fundamental challenges of NLP and covers essential topics such as language models and text classification.

3. **Natural Language Processing Specialization**  
   *Provider:* DeepLearning.AI via Coursera  
   *Level:* Intermediate  
   *Duration:* Approximately 4 months  
   *Link:* [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)  
   *Description:* A comprehensive program covering various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more, with hands-on projects.

4. **Natural Language Processing with Attention Models**  
   *Provider:* DeepLearning.AI via Coursera  
   *Level:* Intermediate  
   *Duration:* 1-4 weeks  
   *Link:* [Natural Language Processing with Attention Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)  
   *Description:* Focuses on advanced NLP techniques, particularly attention mechanisms, and their applications in tasks like machine translation and text summarization.

5. **Mastering Generative AI: Language Models with Transformers**  
   *Provider:* IBM via edX  
   *Level:* Advanced  
   *Duration:* 4 weeks  
   *Link:* [Mastering Generative AI: Language Models with Transformers](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/ibm-mastering-generative-ai-language-models-with-transformers)  
   *Description:* Delves into transformer-based language models like GPT and BERT, essential for understanding state-of-the-art NLP applications.

This progression ensures a structured learning experience, starting with foundational AI concepts and advancing to sophisticated NLP models and techniques.
